# php-travis-experiment

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hairmare/php-travis-experiment.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hairmare/php-travis-experiment)

What originally started as a simple travis experiment is now
somewhat an example php module for intergration with alot of
stuff.

* phpcodesniffer with my favorite custom standard
* phpunit support
* simple composer/packagist config

There are also some ongoing experiments

* documentation in the cloud (sphinx/readthedocs or something similar, i need API doxing, though)

## example stuff

```php
/**
 * this is some syntax highlighted php code.
 */
```
