.. PHP Travis Experiment documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PHP Travis Experiment's documentation!
=================================================

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

This is mainly a blank index file to get me somewhere.

This repository does not contain much so all that is left to do is document the smallish api that exists.

.. php:class:: MyClass

  Simple rather empty class that doesn't do much.


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
